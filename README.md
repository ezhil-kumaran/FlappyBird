THIS IS A SMALL FLAPPY BIRD GAME for PC CREATED BY ME WITHIN A SPAN OF 5 DAYS for a club interview.THE SCRIPTS (.cs files)I HAVE USED ARE VISIBLE IN THE ASSET FOLDER ,FOR YOUR REFERENCE. 

I DONT THINK U CAN DOWNLOAD THE ZIP FILE TO PLAY THE GAME AS GITHUB DOESNT SUPPORT FILES ABOVE 25MB,I WILL TRY TO COMPRESS AND UPLOAD IT OR I WILL MAKE IT AS WEB PLAYABLE AND ATTACH the link HERE.

THE GAME IS STRICTLY FOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES AND DOESNT MEAN TO REPLICATE THE ORIGINAL FLAPPY BIRD GAME.THE BACKGROUND IMAGES,ASSETS,SFX,MUSIC ALL ARE  FREE PROPERTIES DOWNLOADED FROM "itch.io" and kenney assets.

so enjoy the game and feel free to give any feedbacks.
